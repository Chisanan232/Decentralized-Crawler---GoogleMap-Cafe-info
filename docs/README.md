# Decentralized Crawler - GoogleMap Cafe info

### Description
A decentralized crawler which target to crawl GoogleMap cafe data (shop information). 


### Motivation
This project exist for my side project about ... maybe you should think it like "Coffee Google".
We need to integrate all data which from different sources and must to crawl data from internet. 
However, general crawler is too slow to get target data we want, especially we crawl data with Selenium.


### Information
This is a decentralized crawler with framework Akka. That could help us build a architectured with high performance crawler.
